# Other Auth Methods

If OIDC or our built-in auth doesn't suit your needs, there's plenty of other ways of protecting your dashboard from unauthenticated access.

- [Reverse Proxy Auth](#reverse-proxy-auth) - Authelia, Authentik, or similar sitting in front of Dashy
- [Zero-Trust Tunnels](#zero-trust-tunnels) - Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel
- [VPN](#vpn) - Keep Dashy off the internet entirely
- [IP-Based Access](#ip-based-access) - Restrict by source IP in your web server
- [Web Server Authentication](#web-server-authentication) - HTTP basic auth at the proxy level
- [Client Certificates (mTLS)](#client-certificates-mtls) - Require a client TLS certificate to connect
- [SSO / OAuth Providers](#sso--oauth-providers) - Cloud-hosted identity providers
- [Cloud Hosting Providers](#cloud-hosting-providers) - Built-in auth on hosting platforms

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every method on this page except header auth authenticates at the network or proxy edge, not inside Dashy. Dashy's own server stays open to anything that can reach it directly, so don't expose its port publicly: bind it to localhost or an internal network and only let the proxy or tunnel through. If you want app-level auth with per-user roles, use [OIDC](./oidc.md), [built-in auth](./built-in.md), or [header auth](./header-auth.md) instead.

## Reverse proxy auth

The most common setup for self-hosters running multiple services. Your reverse proxy delegates login to an auth server (forward auth), which handles login, 2FA, and sessions for everything behind it. You configure it once, and all your apps get protected.

Dashy has [Header Authentication](./header-auth.md) support, so when your proxy authenticates a user and forwards their identity via a header, Dashy picks up the username and maps it to a configured user automatically. No separate Dashy login needed.

**Authelia** is lightweight and Docker-friendly. It supports 2FA, per-path access rules, and multiple user backends. To get started quickly:

1. `git clone https://github.com/authelia/authelia.git`
2. `cd authelia/examples/compose/lite`
3. Edit `users_database.yml`, `configuration.yml`, and `docker-compose.yml` for your domain and users
4. `docker compose up -d`

See the [Authelia docs](https://www.authelia.com/docs/) for the full setup guide.

**Authentik** is heavier but gives you a proper admin UI, built-in OIDC/SAML support, and user self-service (password resets, enrollment flows, etc). Good if you want a single identity provider across many apps. See the [authentik Docker Compose install](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/installation/docker-compose) to get started, and the [authentik guide](./authentik.md) for Dashy-specific OIDC config.

**OAuth2 Proxy** ([docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/)) is a thin forward-auth layer that puts any OIDC or OAuth2 provider (Google, GitHub, your own IdP) in front of apps that can't do it themselves. Point it at Dashy's [header auth](./header-auth.md) and it forwards the authenticated username, so you get provider login without Dashy needing to reach the provider directly.

## Zero-trust tunnels

These let you expose Dashy to the internet without opening inbound ports or configuring port forwarding. Auth is handled by the tunnel provider before traffic ever reaches your server.

**Cloudflare Tunnel** connects Dashy to Cloudflare's edge network via an outbound-only `cloudflared` daemon (runs nicely as a Docker sidecar). Cloudflare handles DNS, TLS, and DDoS protection. Pair it with Cloudflare Access to require identity provider login before anyone reaches Dashy. The free tier covers most home setups. Dashy has a full [Cloudflare Tunnel guide](./cloudflare-tunnel.md), or see the [upstream docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/).

**Tailscale Funnel** exposes Dashy through your Tailscale mesh to the public internet, with automatic TLS. Simpler to set up than Cloudflare but you get less control over access policies. See Dashy's [Tailscale guide](./tailscale.md), or the [upstream Funnel docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel).

### Service worker & offline use

If you run Dashy behind any of the redirect-based proxies or tunnels above and also enable the service worker for offline use (`appConfig.enableServiceWorker: true`), set `appConfig.enableAuthProxyCompat: true` as well. Without it, when your proxy session expires the cached app can get stuck, with the service worker serving the old page instead of letting the proxy redirect you to its login screen. With it enabled, Dashy detects the expiry on load and reloads so you can sign in again.

## VPN

A VPN keeps Dashy off the public internet entirely. You connect to your home network remotely and access Dashy like you're on the LAN. No auth to configure, no attack surface to worry about. The downside: you need the VPN running to see anything, and some networks (corporate WiFi, hotels) block VPN traffic.

[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is fast and minimal. Most self-hosters run it through a UI like [wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy), which gives you a web interface for managing peers and generating QR codes for mobile.

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) wraps WireGuard and takes care of NAT traversal, key exchange, and device management. No port forwarding needed, works across networks with zero config. There's a generous free tier, and Dashy has a dedicated [Tailscale guide](./tailscale.md). [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) is a self-hosted coordination server if you want to keep everything on your own infrastructure.

[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) still works fine if you already have it running, but for a new setup WireGuard or Tailscale are easier to get going.

## IP-based access

If you have a static IP or are already on a VPN, you can restrict access to Dashy by source IP at the web server level. This works well as an extra layer on top of other auth methods.

NGINX:
```text
location / {
    proxy_pass http://dashy:8080;
    allow 192.168.1.0/24;
    allow 203.0.113.50;
    deny all;
}
```

Caddy ([request matchers docs](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/matchers)):
```text
dashy.example.com {
    @blocked not remote_ip 192.168.1.0/24 203.0.113.50
    respond @blocked "Access denied" 403
    reverse_proxy dashy:8080
}
```

Apache (2.4+):
```text
<Location />
    Require ip 192.168.1.0/24
    Require ip 203.0.113.50
</Location>
```

## Web server authentication

Your reverse proxy can handle HTTP basic auth directly, no extra services needed. This gives you a browser login prompt in front of Dashy. Make sure you're using HTTPS, as basic auth sends credentials base64-encoded (not encrypted) with every request.

NGINX ([auth module docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html)):
```text
location / {
    auth_basic "Dashy";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/.htpasswd;
    proxy_pass http://dashy:8080;
}
```

Generate the password file with `htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/conf.d/.htpasswd alicia`.

Caddy ([basicauth directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/basicauth)):
```text
dashy.example.com {
    basicauth {
        alicia $2a$14$... # generate with: caddy hash-password
    }
    reverse_proxy dashy:8080
}
```

Apache:
```text
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Dashy"
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```

Generate the password file with `htpasswd -c /path/to/.htpasswd alicia`.

## Client certificates (mTLS)

Instead of a password, you can require a client TLS certificate to reach Dashy. The browser presents a cert you've issued, the proxy rejects anyone without a valid one. It's strong and can't be phished, but you have to generate, hand out, and occasionally revoke the certs, so it fits a small fixed set of devices better than a large user base.

You'll need your own CA to sign the client certs. [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is fine for a handful, [step-ca](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) if you want to manage them properly.

NGINX:
```text
server {
    ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/ca.crt;
    ssl_verify_client on;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://dashy:8080;
    }
}
```

Caddy and Apache do mTLS too, via `client_auth` and `SSLVerifyClient require` respectively.

## SSO / OAuth providers

Cloud identity providers like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/), [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/), and [Google Cloud Identity](https://cloud.google.com/identity) can work with Dashy through its [OIDC support](./oidc.md). If your provider speaks OIDC (most do), just configure it as described in the OIDC section and you're set.

For providers that only support OAuth2 or SAML without an OIDC layer, you'll need something in between to translate. Authentik, Keycloak, and Authelia can all bridge from SAML/OAuth2 to OIDC.

## Cloud hosting providers

If you're running Dashy on a cloud platform, most have their own auth options you can enable without touching Dashy's config. See your provider's docs: [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/), [Netlify Password Protection](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/), [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Azure App Service Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization), and [Vercel Password Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/password-protection).
