# Cloud Services

Dashy is intended to be run locally, within your LAN/homelab. But it can also be deployed to the cloud for certain use cases.

Where possible, I've included templates and 1-click install links, so you can deploy your own instance in under a minute.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - It's your responsibility to secure your instance and set up access control
> - On pure static / CDN hosting, Dashy's server endpoints (like saving config through the UI) don't work
> - Links are unofficial unless otherwise stated, so we can't offer support for them

## Static Hosting Providers

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is static hosting with Git deploys. Click the button and Netlify uses the included [`netlify.toml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/netlify.toml) to build and publish Dashy. Alternatively, fork the repo and import your fork into Netlify, so changes redeploy automatically. Your fork can be private if needed. Dashy's status checks and CORS proxy run as Netlify functions (wired up in `netlify.toml`), so those work here, though saving config through the UI still doesn't.

### Cloudflare Pages

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is static hosting on Cloudflare's edge. Import the repo, set build command `yarn build`, and set output directory `dist`.


### Firebase Hosting

[Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting) is static hosting on Google's CDN. Run `yarn build`, deploy `dist` with the Firebase CLI, and add an SPA rewrite to `index.html`.

### Azure Static Web Apps

## Container Runtimes

> [!NOTE]
> These run Dashy's Node server, so status checks and server endpoints work. Mount `/app/user-data` if config edits or uploaded assets should survive restarts.

### Render

[Render](https://render.com/) is managed container hosting. Click the button and Render uses the included [`render.yaml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/render.yaml) to build Dashy. To persist `user-data`, uncomment the disk in that file, which requires a paid plan.

### Railway

[Railway](https://railway.com/) is managed container hosting. Click the button to deploy the Dashy template with `lissy93/dashy:latest` and a persistent `/app/user-data` volume.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://forthebadge.com/api/badges/generate?panels=2&primaryLabel=Deploy&secondaryLabel=Railway&primaryBGColor=%23393939&primaryTextColor=%23FFFFFF&secondaryBGColor=%230B0D0E&secondaryIcon=railway&borderRadius=2)](https://railway.com/deploy/dashy)



### Fly.io

[Fly.io](https://fly.io/) runs Docker apps on Fly Machines. Install [`flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/), log in, then run the following. If it asks you for the internal port, use `8080`

```bash
fly launch --from https://github.com/lissy93/dashy --no-deploy
fly deploy
```


### Koyeb

[Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) is serverless container hosting. Click the button to deploy `lissy93/dashy:latest` from Docker Hub with HTTP port `8080`.

[![Deploy to Koyeb](https://forthebadge.com/api/badges/generate?panels=2&primaryLabel=Deploy&secondaryLabel=Koyeb&primaryBGColor=%23393939&primaryTextColor=%23FFFFFF&secondaryBGColor=%23121212&secondaryIcon=koyeb&borderRadius=2)](https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?type=docker&image=docker.io/lissy93/dashy:latest&name=dashy&ports=8080%3Bhttp%3B%2F)


### Northflank

[Northflank](https://northflank.com/) is managed container hosting. To get started, either follow [this guide](https://northflank.com/guides/deploy-dashy-with-northflank), or use the 1-click button below.

```bash
az containerapp up \
  --name dashy \
  --image docker.io/lissy93/dashy:latest \
  --ingress external \
  --target-port 8080
```

### Google Cloud Run

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is serverless container hosting on Google Cloud. Click the button to open Cloud Shell and build Dashy from the repo's `Dockerfile`.

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://forthebadge.com/api/badges/generate?panels=2&primaryLabel=Deploy&secondaryLabel=Cloud%20Run&primaryBGColor=%23393939&primaryTextColor=%23FFFFFF&secondaryBGColor=%234285F4&secondaryIcon=googlecloud&borderRadius=2)](https://deploy.cloud.run/?git_repo=https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy)

## Managed Hosting

- [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/dashy) - Fully managed Dashy, or bring your own VM
- [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/apps/) - Managed open-source app hosting; search for Dashy and click **Run Your Own**
- [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/applications/dashy) - VPS hosting with a one-click Dashy Docker template

---

## Hosting with any CDN

Once Dashy has been built, it is effectively just a static web app. This means that it can be served up with pretty much any static host, CDN or web server. To host Dashy through a CDN, the steps are very similar to building from source: clone the project, cd into it, install dependencies, write your config file and build the app. Once build is complete you will have a `./dist` directory within Dashy's root, and this is the build application which is ready to be served up.

However without Dashy's node server, there are a couple of features that will be unavailable to you, including: writing config changes to disk through the UI, and application status checks. Everything else will work fine.

## Other VPS

Dashy can be deployed to almost any VPS provider by following our [Docker](/docs/deployment/docker.md) guide.
